# Pytorch Face Super-Resolution Algorithms

This repository contains the results of some standard and proposed super-resolution algorithms for improving performance in two low-resolution face recognition tasks. The full discussion of the results was presented in my master thesis ["Analysis and evaluation of Deep Learning based Super-Resolution algorithms to improve performance in Low-Resolution Face Recognition"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10845) in 2019.
